## How a virtual machine works.
Virtual machines are made possible through virtualization technology.
Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or "virtual" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer—such as your personal computer— and/or a remote server—such as a server in a cloud provider's datacenter.

## The purpose of virtual machines.
The big draw of virtualization is to operate multiple displays and even systems — Linux and Windows, for example — from the same console. his allows users to toggle among applications regardless of their OS. And resource consumption with VMware can be remarkably lower than resource consumption with multiple hardware-based systems.
